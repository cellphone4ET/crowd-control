# Crowd Control

An app for the introvert in all of us. Users can either search by geolocation or manually submit their location to find out where any large crowds will be in their general area. 

## Motivation

As much as technology is about connecting people, sometimes it's nice to deconnect sans people. This app can help you do that without the need to shut yourself up in your house or go-off grid in the middle of nowhere. 

## Features
* search a city by location or by name
* search a different day
